This project is an assignment for the Harvard Edx online course, PH125.9x Data Science: Capstone. The submission files are: wdbc_report.Rmd, wdbc_report.pdf and wdbc_script.R. Please note that the Rmd and R script files are computationally intensive and need sufficient time to render/run. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning algorithm that accurately discriminates between malignant and benign breast lesions using the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer data set. This data set has been widely used for this purpose and accuracies approaching 100% have been achieved in the past. The R caretEnsemble package is used to train six caret models, with and without principal component analysis. Ensembles of the models are created in an effort to increase prediction accuracy. Results approaching those reported by other authors are achieved.
